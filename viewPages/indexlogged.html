                        Sophia is Hanson Robotics’ latest and most advanced robot to date and a cultural icon. She has become a media darling, appearing on major media outlets around the world, igniting the interest of people regardless of age, gender, and culture, even gracing the cover of one of the top fashion magazines.  Her press coverage has a potential reach of over ten billion readers in 2017.

                        Sophia is a highly sought-after speaker in business and showed her prowess and great potential across many industries. She has met face-to-face with key decision makers in banking, insurance, auto manufacturing, property development, media, and entertainment. In addition, she has appeared onstage as a panel member and presenter in high-level conferences, covering how robotics and artificial intelligence will become a prevalent part of people’s lives. Her reputation extends beyond business into the global social arena. She was named the world’s first United Nation Innovation Champion by United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and will have an official role in working with UNDP to promote sustainable development and safeguard human rights and equality.

                        Sophia is an evolving genius machine. Her incredible human likeness, expressiveness, and remarkable story as an awakening robot over time makes her a fascinating front-page technology story.

                        Sophia’s creator, Dr. David Hanson, is the founder of Hanson Robotics and a modern-day renaissance man who has built a worldwide reputation for creating robots that look and act amazingly human. After working at Disney as an “Imagineer,” Dr. Hanson aspired to create genius machines that will surpass human intelligence. Dr. Hanson believes that three distinctively human traits must be integrated into the artificial intelligence of these genius machines: Creativity, empathy, and compassion. As an extension of human intelligence, Hanson Robotics’ genius machines can evolve to solve world problems too complex for humans to solve themselves. Sophia personifies this bold and responsible goal.

                        Please follow Sophia’s journey to observe and engage with her as she develops into an exciting platform for artificial general intelligence (AGI) and service robotics applications in business, medical/healthcare, and education.

                        <h2>Erica, the humanoid robot, is chatty but still has a lot to learn?</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>
                        KYOTO, Japan — Erica greets me, asks my name and how I’m enjoying my trip to Japan. She nods her head as I speak and her eyes wander, but she seems only to be listening to me.

                        This eerie humanoid just happens to be a “conversational” robot companion. But the conversation only goes so far: She’s reciting from a digital file that has been placed inside her as I read into a microphone from a script of questions researchers have given me to prompt her.

                        ErIca is part of a five-year research project to build a talking friend for an aging, shrinking population in Japan.

                        “In Japan, many are living alone, and they need to have a conversation with others,” says Takashi Minato, a researcher with Hiroshi Ishiguro Laboratories. “The human-like robot can help support them.”

                        The robot revolution is active worldwide. In the U.S., companies are looking to robots to replace menial labor in the coming years. Electronics manufacturers showed various degrees of robots at the CES trade show last month that, for the most part, basically bring a set of digital eyes and smiles to smart connected speakers like the Amazon Echo and Google Home.
                        But for the cutting edge when it comes to robot companions, Japan is the place to be. Asian researchers are among the leaders in the pursuit of building humanoids, and in Japan, robots are revered. There’s a hotel near Tokyo that attracts visitors by having robots check in guests, a popular robot restaurant (featuring a show of battling Transformer types) and many cartoons, comic books and movies featuring friendly or heroic robots, like Astro Boy.

                        In Hong Kong, researcher David Hanson, whose Hanson Robotics company motto is “We bring robots to life,” has created “Sophia,” a lifelike robot that has appeared at trade shows and The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.

                        Sophia has her Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages, and Erica’s creator talks about how she read the news as an anchor for a Japan TV station.

                        But neither Sophia nor Erica are available for sale and won’t be for some time.  If she were for sale, Erica would cost somewhere over $200,000, says Minato.
                        Could the humanoid robot experience fly here? Not for years, says Jim Boerkoel, a professor of computer science at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, Calif.

                        Robots here will be “service machines,” and that’s it, for now.

                        “People will be more likely to go towards robots that are cute and friendly, in an animated form factor that is clearly separate from being human,” he says.

                        Consumer robots are just starting to join the marketplace in the U.S., and the two that are most widely available both fall into the Alexa-with-eyes variety:
