                        KYOTO, Japan — Erica greets me, asks my name and how I’m enjoying my trip to Japan. She nods her head as I speak and her eyes wander, but she seems only to be listening to me.

                        This eerie humanoid just happens to be a “conversational” robot companion. But the conversation only goes so far: She’s reciting from a digital file that has been placed inside her as I read into a microphone from a script of questions researchers have given me to prompt her.

                        ErIca is part of a five-year research project to build a talking friend for an aging, shrinking population in Japan.

                        “In Japan, many are living alone, and they need to have a conversation with others,” says Takashi Minato, a researcher with Hiroshi Ishiguro Laboratories. “The human-like robot can help support them.”

                        The robot revolution is active worldwide. In the U.S., companies are looking to robots to replace menial labor in the coming years. Electronics manufacturers showed various degrees of robots at the CES trade show last month that, for the most part, basically bring a set of digital eyes and smiles to smart connected speakers like the Amazon Echo and Google Home.
                        But for the cutting edge when it comes to robot companions, Japan is the place to be. Asian researchers are among the leaders in the pursuit of building humanoids, and in Japan, robots are revered. There’s a hotel near Tokyo that attracts visitors by having robots check in guests, a popular robot restaurant (featuring a show of battling Transformer types) and many cartoons, comic books and movies featuring friendly or heroic robots, like Astro Boy.

                        In Hong Kong, researcher David Hanson, whose Hanson Robotics company motto is “We bring robots to life,” has created “Sophia,” a lifelike robot that has appeared at trade shows and The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.

                        Sophia has her Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages, and Erica’s creator talks about how she read the news as an anchor for a Japan TV station.

                        But neither Sophia nor Erica are available for sale and won’t be for some time.  If she were for sale, Erica would cost somewhere over $200,000, says Minato.
                        Could the humanoid robot experience fly here? Not for years, says Jim Boerkoel, a professor of computer science at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, Calif.

                        Robots here will be “service machines,” and that’s it, for now.

                        “People will be more likely to go towards robots that are cute and friendly, in an animated form factor that is clearly separate from being human,” he says.

                        Consumer robots are just starting to join the marketplace in the U.S., and the two that are most widely available both fall into the Alexa-with-eyes variety:
